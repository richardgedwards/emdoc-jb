# Welcome to Electromagnetism Documentation

The intent of this project is to document electromagnetic theory with a consistent notation. This will be used to develop and explore computational electromagnetic algorithms for solving Maxwell's equations, both analytically and numerically.

## Who is this book for?

This book is for anyone with a basic understanding of calculus and physics who wants to learn about:

*   Maxwell's Equations
*   Electromagnetic Waves
*   Waveguides and Cavities
*   Radiation and Antennas

## How to use this book

The book is organized into chapters, each covering a major topic in electromagnetism. Within each chapter, you will find sections with detailed explanations, mathematical derivations, and interactive simulations in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

We recommend going through the chapters in order, but feel free to jump to the topics that are most relevant to your interests.
